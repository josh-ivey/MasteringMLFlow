5. Organizing code and data with an MLFlow Project: 

- Modify your existing MLFlow Project to include multiple scripts or notebooks and data files, 
and use the mlflow.projects.run function to run the different components of the project. 
- You should update the MLproject file to specify the entry points and parameters for each component of the project, and use the mlflow.projects.backend and mlflow.projects.param functions to configure the project to run on a remote execution backend and pass parameters between the different components.
