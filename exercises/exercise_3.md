3. Customizing experiment tracking: 
Customize the experiment tracking process by using the mlflow.start_run and mlflow.end_run 
functions to define the scope of each run, and by using the mlflow.set_tag function 
to add custom tags to each run. Then use the UI to filter and sort runs based on these custom tags.
