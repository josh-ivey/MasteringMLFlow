10. Using MLFlow for the end-to-end ML Workflow

A. Set up an MLFlow Project: 
- Create a new MLFlow Project using the mlflow.create_experiment 
  function, and create an MLproject file to specify the entry points and 
  parameters for the project.

B. Run experiments and track results: 
- Modify your code to log experiment data using the MLFlow tracking
  API, and use the mlflow.projects.run function to run your code 
  within the MLFlow Project. 
- Run multiple experiments with different hyperparameter values and log the 
  results using the mlflow.log_param and mlflow.log_metric functions.

C. Train and deploy a model: 
- Use the mlflow.sklearn module to log and deploy a scikit-learn model 
 using MLFlow. 
- Use the mlflow.sklearn.log_model and mlflow.sklearn.deploy 
  functions to log and deploy the model, and use the 
  mlflow.sklearn.load_model function to test the deployed model.

D. Serve the model and track its performance: 
- Use the mlflow.models.serve function to serve the deployed model 
  for online predictions, and use the mlflow.models.predict function 
  to test the model. 
- Use the mlflow.register_model function to register the model in 
  the MLFlow Model Registry, and use the mlflow.log_model function to log the
  model's performance over time.
